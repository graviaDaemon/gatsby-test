description: The reasons I haven't been able to figure this out without asking for help.

I've found maybe 3 or 4 documentations on how to add Microsoft Graph to a gatsby framework, however all of them were different.

The only thing that did remain the same, was the fact that I needed an Azure console account, and a client ID key. \
Which I did get, after following Microsoft's own explanations.\
So far, that is how far I've gotten. Even after installing the various packages and libraries required by any of the documents I've found. Tried some of the code, tried editing it and playing around with it. \
Now all I'm left with is a menial static website grabbed from a template and worked with Netlify-CMS to make these blog posts.

I've changed my description and such in the main page, sure. But it didn't take many changes for that to happen.

The documentations I've found were these websites:  
- [make a plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-microsoft-graph)
- [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/get-started/use-toolkit-with-react)
- [More Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/tutorials/react)
